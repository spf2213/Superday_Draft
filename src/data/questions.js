  {id:103,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"If depreciation increases by $10 (40% tax rate), how does it affect the financial statements?",a:"Net income falls by $6 (because $10 depreciation reduces EBIT, saving $4 in taxes at 40%), cash increases by $4 (adding back depreciation), and on the Balance Sheet cash is up $4, PP&E is down $10, and retained earnings is down $6.",wrong:["Net income increases by $4 and cash flow is unchanged.","Net income drops by $10 and cash drops by $10.","Only the Balance Sheet is affected: PP&E down $10 and equity down $10."],tip:"Memorise this cold \u2014 it appears in almost every technical interview.",difficulty:1},
  {id:104,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"What is the difference between cash accounting and accrual accounting?",a:"Cash accounting recognizes revenue and expenses only when cash is received or paid, whereas accrual accounting recognizes revenue when earned and expenses when incurred, regardless of when cash changes hands.",wrong:["There is no difference \u2013 both record transactions the same way.","Cash accounting records only cash transactions; accrual records only credit.","Accrual accounting waits for cash collection, unlike cash accounting."],tip:"Public companies must use accrual accounting under GAAP/IFRS.",difficulty:1},
  {id:105,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"How can a company have positive net income but go bankrupt?",a:"If net income is not translating to cash \u2013 for example, working capital deterioration (revenues tied up in accounts receivable) or large debt obligations can drain cash despite accounting profits.",wrong:["That\u2019s impossible \u2013 positive net income always means the company is fine.","Only if the accounting is incorrect; otherwise it cannot happen.","This only happens if the company spends too much on advertising."],tip:"Cash is king \u2014 profitability doesn\u2019t guarantee solvency.",difficulty:1},
  {id:106,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"What is EBITDA and why is it important?",a:"EBITDA stands for Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization.

  {id:107,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"How does an increase in accounts receivable affect cash flow?",a:"If AR rises, revenue and net income increase, but no cash is received \u2013 it uses cash (reducing operating cash flow) because cash collection is delayed.",wrong:["It increases both net income and cash immediately.","It has no impact on cash flow.","It only affects the Balance Sheet by moving cash into receivables."],tip:"Rising AR is a red flag for cash flow quality \u2014 revenue growth without collection.",difficulty:1},
  {id:108,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"What is the difference between accounts payable and accrued expenses?",a:"Both are current liabilities, but AP is typically for invoiced purchases on credit, while accrued expenses are incurred but not yet invoiced expenses (like salaries or utilities).",wrong:["They mean exactly the same thing with no distinction.","Accounts payable are long-term debts, accrued expenses are short-term.","Accrued expenses are already paid in cash, whereas AP are not."],tip:"Think: AP has an invoice, accrued expenses are estimated/accumulated.",difficulty:2},
  {id:109,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"If you could only use one financial statement to evaluate a company, which would you choose?",a:"The Cash Flow Statement \u2013 because it shows actual cash generation, providing a true picture of liquidity. It\u2019s more telling than the IS (which includes non-cash items) or BS (a snapshot).",wrong:["The Income Statement, because it shows the company\u2019s profit directly.","The Balance Sheet, because it shows the company\u2019s net worth.","It doesn\u2019t matter; all statements give the same information."],tip:"Justify your choice by explaining what the others miss.",difficulty:2},

  {id:112,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"Why is debt often considered a cheaper source of financing than equity?",a:"Because interest on debt is tax-deductible (creating a tax shield) and debt investors have priority in repayment (lower risk), debt usually has a lower required return than equity.",wrong:["Equity is cheaper since dividends are optional.","Debt is cheaper because you never have to pay it back.","Equity financing always lowers WACC compared to debt."],tip:"The tax shield is the key reason \u2014 interest expense reduces taxable income.",difficulty:2},
  {id:113,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"What is net working capital?",a:"NWC = Current Assets \u2013 Current Liabilities.

Use the treasury stock method for options.",difficulty:3},
  {id:130,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"What is other comprehensive income (OCI)?",a:"OCI captures gains/losses that bypass the IS and go directly to equity on the BS.

  {id:131,cat:'tech',sub:'accounting',q:"How does a write-down of inventory affect the three statements?",a:"IS: COGS increases, reducing net income. CFS: NI decreases but the write-down is non-cash and added back \u2014 net cash impact is zero. BS: Inventory decreases, retained earnings decrease.",wrong:["Cash decreases by the write-down amount.","It only affects the balance sheet.","Net income increases because expenses are removed."],tip:"Write-downs are non-cash \u2014 same concept as depreciation flowing through the statements.",difficulty:3},
